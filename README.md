# jquery.link-decorators

A family of jQuery plugins with custom link selectors and useful link modifiers.
These help with creating consistent markup for links to downloadable files, offsite
links, etc., that can show details like file size and file type. With the help of some
CSS styling, these details can be displayed in popup windows.

This is especially useful on a CMS system, to standardize markup and improve usability.
